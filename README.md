## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Tailwind CSS for easy styling
- Svelte (A JavaScript framework)
- Page.js (For SPA routing)

### What I learned

I used this opportunity to quickly get a grasp of how Svelte works. Even though I didn't need to use every single Svelte concepts, I managed to understand quite a lot of concepts. Since I already knew React, It was easy to learn. The concepts are quite similar between these frameworks. But man, coming from React, I f\*\*\*ing fell in love with Svelte. Things are so much easier in Svelte.

### Continued development

I would probably continue learning about Svelte, and maybe even SvelteKit.
